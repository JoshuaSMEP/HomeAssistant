blueprint:
  name: Alternating Scenes Looper
  description: |
    Creates a script to continuously alternate between two scenes.
    - Applies the provided scene with transition.
    - Waits the dwell time.
    - Recursively calls itself with the other scene.
    Use an input_boolean to enable/disable the loop (turn it ON to start, OFF to stop).
